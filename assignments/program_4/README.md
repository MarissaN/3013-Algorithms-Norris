Assignment: Program 4 Spanning Tree

Description:  This program creates a graph structure with cities as Vertices and no Edges initially. 
          		Fully connects the cities by adding edges between cities that are close together.
          		Then creates a connected graph of all the cities so that every city is reachable 
          		by ensuring that each vertex has a max degree of 3, 
            	where each edge represents one of three closest cities to that vertex
